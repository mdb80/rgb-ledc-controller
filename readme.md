# RGB LED Controller Library for ESP32 (ESP-IDF)

This repository contains an implementation of an RGB LED Controller Library, compatible with ESP32 microcontrollers and ESP-IDF version 5.0.2.

The library provides functionality to initialize and control the brightness and color of RGB LEDs through a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) interface using ESP-IDF's LED Control (LEDC) module.

## Features

Here's what the RGB LED Controller Library offers:

- **Independent LED Control**: Each RGB LED can be controlled independently, which allows for complex lighting effects across multiple LEDs. Please note that the maximum number of LEDs that can be controlled simultaneously is limited to 2 due to the LEDC module having only 8 channels available.
- **Color and Brightness Control**: The library provides precise control over the color (through RGB values) and brightness (through PWM signal) of each LED.
- **Various Lighting Effects**: Several lighting effects are supported including blinking, color transitions, and "breathing" effects (gradual brightening and dimming). Each effect comes with customizable timing parameters to fit a variety of application needs.
- **Easy-to-Use API**: The functions provided by the library have a straightforward interface, making it easy to add sophisticated LED control to your ESP32 projects.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install the RGB LED Controller library:

1. First, clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by navigating to the directory where you want to clone the repository and then using the following command in your terminal: 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mdb80/rgb-led-controller.git
    ```

2. Open your ESP-IDF project in Visual Studio Code.

3. In the Explorer sidebar, you'll see your project structure. Navigate to the `components` directory in your project.

4. The library is now ready to be used in your project. To use it, include the `rgb_ledc_controller.h` file in your source code. The ESP-IDF build system will automatically build and link the library.

## Example

Before using the RGB LED, the PWM interface needs to be configured:

```c

#include "rgb_ledc_controller.h" // Include the header file for the RGB LED functions

// Define the GPIO pins for the Red, Green, and Blue LEDs
#define GPIO_LED_RED 18  
#define GPIO_LED_GREEN 19
#define GPIO_LED_BLUE 20 

// Define colors as RGB values in hexadecimal
#define RED     0xFF0000 // Red color
#define GREEN   0x00FF00 // Green color
#define BLUE    0x0000FF // Blue color
#define YELLOW  0xFFFF00 // Yellow color (combination of Red and Green)
#define VIOLET  0xEE82EE // Violet color

// The main function of the program
void app_main(void)
{
    // Create an instance of the RGB LED structure and initialize it with the defined GPIO pins and LEDC channels
    rgb_led_t led1 = rgb_led_new(GPIO_LED_RED, GPIO_LED_GREEN, GPIO_LED_BLUE, LEDC_CHANNEL_0, LEDC_CHANNEL_1, LEDC_CHANNEL_2);
    //...you can add one more eg: led2.It is limited to 2 leds due to the LEDC module having only 8 channels available.
    
    // Initialize the RGB LED, check for any errors during the process
    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(rgb_led_init(&led1));

    // Main loop of the program
    while (true){
        // Start a "breathing" effect with the Red color and a period of 100ms
        rgb_led_start_breath_effect(&led1, RED, 100);
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(5000)); // Delay for 5 seconds

        // Start a blinking effect with the Green color. Blink 3 times, each blink lasts 500ms, and the time between blinks is 500ms. The total effect duration is 3000ms.
        rgb_led_start_blink_effect(&led1, GREEN, 3, 500, 500, 3000);
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(5000)); // Delay for 5 seconds

        // Start a "breathing" effect with the Blue color and a period of 100ms
        rgb_led_start_breath_effect(&led1, BLUE, 100);
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(5000)); // Delay for 5 seconds

        // Start a blinking effect with the Yellow color. Blink 3 times, each blink lasts 500ms, and the time between blinks is 500ms. The total effect duration is 3000ms.
        rgb_led_start_blink_effect(&led1, YELLOW, 3, 500, 500, 3000);
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(5000)); // Delay for 5 seconds

        // Start a color transition effect from Yellow to Red, the total effect duration is 5000ms.
        rgb_led_start_transition_effect(&led1, YELLOW,RED, 5000);
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(5000)); // Delay for 5 seconds

        // Set the LED color Fixed to Violet
        rgb_led_set_color(&led1,VIOLET);
    }
}
